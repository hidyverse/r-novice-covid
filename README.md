## Introduction to R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis

An introduction to R for non-programmers using the [University of Arizona Test-Trace-Treat COVID-19 testing](https://arizona.figshare.com/articles/dataset/University_of_Arizona_Test-Trace-Treat_COVID-19_testing_results/14869740) data.
Please see <https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-gapminder> for the original version of this material,
[the lesson template documentation][lesson-example]
for instructions on formatting, building, and submitting material,
or run `make` in this directory for a list of helpful commands.

A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are
packages we find useful, and have been chosen primarily for their
usability.
