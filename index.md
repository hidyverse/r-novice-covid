### *An introduction to R for non-programmers using [Test-Trace-Treat](https://covid19.arizona.edu/test-trace-treat) data*

The goal of this lesson is to teach novice programmers to use R for data analysis. 
The emphasis of these materials is to give
attendees a strong foundation in R, and to teach best
practices for managing projects, seeking help, and working with data in R.

Note that this workshop will focus on teaching the fundamentals of the
programming language R, and will not teach statistical analysis.


A variety of third party packages are used throughout this workshop. These
are not necessarily the best, nor are they comprehensive, but they are useful
packages to know.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Understand that computers store data and instructions (programs, scripts etc.) in files.
> Files are organised in directories (folders).
> Know how to access files not in the working directory by specifying the path.
